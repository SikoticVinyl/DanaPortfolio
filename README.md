# Dana Fulmer Portfolio

## Description

This project is a portfolio page to display my most recent works as I continue to grow and learn as a developer. Ideally this will eventually become a resource I can use for myself to provide to potential employers to help secure a job as an developer!

This project will morph and change and be re-designed as I learn more and am able to do more with it, so with that in mind I want to create a sort of record of itterations here in the read me.

This project started out as simple wiring created during class, which can be seen here!

I have learned a lot about HTML and CSS creating this site so far, especially about how flex works and moves things around the pages along side containers and how they work and are created.

Some of the issues that I have run into so far has been getting some of my originally planned image elements to fit the spaces that I was putting them in. For now I have replaced those images with a solid background color and intend to re-design the images in MidJourney and then come back and re-add them.

## Usage

To use my portfolio, you should be able to click on the underlined text in the nav bar by contact information and it should link to the corresponding contact ifo. 

Additionally, all of the little banner options under my work will have a title related to the project. When clicked it should re-direct to the deployed project it is in referance to.

You can visit the deployed page here: https://sikoticvinyl.github.io/SikoticPortfolio/
