            <h2> About Me!</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! My name is Dana Fulmer and welcome to my space. I am currently a bootcamp student for a fullstack web development course, so over time many of the elements here in this site will be changing and growing as I grow!
                <br>
                <br>
                I am located in beautiful Southern Utah in St. George, and love the area. In my free time I can often be found in discord spending time with the community I have grown and playing videogames, or with my boyfriend and my animals (I have two dogs and two cats) hanging out at home or out and about. We love going bike riding when the weather is not too hot!
                Occasioanlly I also stream on twitch, and in the winter become a shredder on the mountains!
                <br>
                <br>
                Some of my more technical interests include Ai and its growth. Specifically I follow MidJourney and hope to possibly help contribute to their efforts! I am excited to see how our world will change with Ai as it continues to grow.
                <br>
                <br>
                In a more professional setting, I am currently working for Morgan Stanley as an Digital Support CSR; basically I take phone calls and help people troubleshoot issues with their online login issues. 
                I have quiet an extensive background in customer service as well as call centers and the tech they use.
                I am hoping that what I am learning I can apply to those different areas in my workplace to improve things for the business and fellow agents as well.
