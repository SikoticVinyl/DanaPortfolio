            <!--Welcome, My name is Dana Fulmer and this is my portfolio. I am currently a bootcamp student for a fullstakc web development course, so over time many of the elements here in this site will be changing and growing as I grow! 
            I am located in Southern Utah, in my free time I am taking care of my four animals (two cats, two dogs), hanging out with my significant other, or chilling in my gaming discord server that I have been running and growing for almost three years now.
            I also enjoy twitch streaming, as well as going outside and riding mountainbikes and shredding snow on the slopes during the winter.

            I am super interested in AI as it is up and coming, specificially Ai Art like Midjourney. The idea of Ai just seems captavating and I am excited to be around as it is up and comming and being built. I can only imagine what kind of changes this will bring to the world!
            As someone that loves using and creating Ai Art, all of the images on this page were created by Midjourney through my own prompting.

            In a more professional setting, I am currently working for an investment firm Morgan Stanley as a digital support CSR, I take phone calls and help people troubleshoot issues with their online logins. I have quiet an extensive background in customer service as well as call centers and the tech they use.
            I am hoping that what I am learning I can apply to those different areas in my workplace to improve things for the business and fellow agents.-->
